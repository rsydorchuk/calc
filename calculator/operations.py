operations.py

This file contains ALL calculator operations that the team will build.

IMPORTANT:
- All developers work in THIS SAME FILE.
- Each developer completes ONLY their own function.
- You are NOT allowed to move your function to a different file.

This shared file is intentional. You will probably create merge conflicts.
That's part of the exercise.
